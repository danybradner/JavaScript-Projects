/*Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there's a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.

With our knowledge of JavaScript, let's convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.*/




let Kelvin = 293;
/*I assigned kelvin to 293. 
I need to convert it to celcius first.*/

let Celsius = Kelvin - 273;
// should equal to 20

let Newton = Math.floor(Celsius *(33/100))
//added .floor() method Math to round down the temp.

let Fahrenheit = Math.floor ((Celsius * (9/5)) + 32);
//added .floor() method Math to round down the temp.

console.log (`When Kelvin is ${Kelvin} than it is ${Fahrenheit} Fahrenheit and ${Newton} Newton`)
//Answer should be: When Kelvin is 293 than it is 68 Fahrenheit and 6 Newton
